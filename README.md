## PCRE2-OCaml - Perl Compatibility Regular Expressions for OCaml

This [OCaml](https://www.ocaml.org)-library interfaces the C-library
[PCRE2](https://www.pcre.org) (Perl-compatibility Regular Expressions).  It can
be used for string matching with "PERL"-style regular expressions.

Fork of the [PCRE2 translation](https://github.com/camlp5/pcre2-ocaml) of the
original [pcre-ocaml project](https://github.com/mmottl/pcre-ocaml) for PCRE2
support.
